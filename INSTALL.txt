Install opam dependencies (should take a few minutes):
```
opam install ppx_deriving tls-lwt cohttp cohttp-async cohttp-lwt cohttp-lwt-unix cohttp-lwt-jsoo cohttp-top lwt_ppx
```

To use operate and try out the UI
```
dune build
make play
```

To view stock prices based on their ticker names (API limited to 5 calls per minute so don't try too many times too fast)
'''
dune build
make view_stock
'''
